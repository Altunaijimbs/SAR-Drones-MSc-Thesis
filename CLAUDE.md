# SAR Drone Project - Claude Memory
*Last Updated: August 8, 2025 (Afternoon)*

## Project Overview
MSc Thesis project: Autonomous Search and Rescue Drone System using ROS2, PX4, AirSim, and UE5.
Deadline: August 15, 2025 (7 days remaining)

## üö® IMPORTANT: Two Flight Control Modes Available

### Mode Selection (Ask at start of session):
1. **SimpleFlight Mode** - Pure AirSim, no PX4 needed, smooth demos
2. **PX4 Mode** - Realistic autopilot, deployable to real drone

Use `./airsim_native_workspace/switch_mode.sh` to toggle between modes.

## Current System State

### Working Components ‚úÖ
- Grid search pattern execution
- Web interface at http://localhost:5000 with HD video (1280x720)
- Vision system (YOLO detection with bounding boxes)
- Home position auto-saving (at >2m altitude with 2s delay)
- Velocity coordinator priority system
- Manual control via smart_keep_alive_node
- **RTH (Return to Home) - FIXED!** Drone correctly flies toward home
- Web control panel with separate altitude/rotation controls
- Yaw control for camera rotation
- **Hybrid position control** - Smooth, fast movements without oscillation
- **Practical LLM** - Natural language commands tested and working
- **Speed optimized** - 4.0 m/s movement for responsive control
- **Pattern System** - Expanding square, spiral, and zigzag patterns implemented
- **Pattern Visualizer** - Real-time matplotlib map showing drone movement
- **Pattern Monitor** - Terminal-based pattern execution monitoring

### Fixed Issues ‚úÖ

#### August 4
1. **RTH Navigation** - Used simple commands as reference, removed incorrect transformation
2. **RTH Cancellation** - Any manual command now cancels RTH
3. **Search Pattern Conflict** - Search aborts when RTH activates
4. **Home Position Auto-Save** - Added 2s delay for stable position
5. **Web Interface** - Added ascend/descend and rotate controls
6. **Camera Quality** - Upgraded to 1920x1080 @ 30 FPS in AirSim

### Remaining Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **Pattern Execution**
   - Initial oscillation observed during pattern testing
   - Fixed by reducing waypoints and adding delays
   - May need further tuning for different pattern sizes

3. **PX4 Integration**
   - PX4 connects before UE5 Play button (should wait for simulator)
   - Preflight check failures after running launch scripts
   - Emergency stop causes velocity coordinator issues

4. **Minor Bugs**
   - Position estimator confusion when using backspace in AirSim
   - Matplotlib threading warnings (fixed with TkAgg backend)

   - Made all scripts executable

#### August 7 (Evening) - SimpleFlight Discovery & AirSim Native
1. **Discovered AirSim Settings Issue**
   - System was using PX4Multirotor mode (requires PX4 SITL)
   - Camera named "front_center" not "0", vehicle named "PX4" not "Drone1"
   - This explained why moveOnPathAsync wasn't working smoothly
   
2. **Created AirSim Native Workspace**
   - New workspace at `/airsim_native_workspace/`
   - Implemented SimpleFlight mode (no PX4 needed!)
   - Created mode switcher script to toggle between PX4 and SimpleFlight
   - Built complete demo suite with smooth patterns
   
3. **Analyzed Cosys AirSim path.py**
   - Found they use moveOnPathAsync with dynamic lookahead
   - Lookahead = velocity + velocity/2 for smooth turns
   - Implemented same approach in our native executors
   
4. **Fixed Pattern Execution Issues**
   - Created precision_pattern_executor with sharp turn detection
   - Increased speeds: 5m/s cruise, 2m/s turns
   - Added approach/departure waypoints for smooth turns
   - Fixed velocity coordinator to accept pattern commands

#### August 7 (Afternoon) - MAVROS Fix & Pattern Improvements
1. **Fixed MAVROS Launch Issue**
   - Updated launch_complete_pattern_system.sh to use same MAVROS command as working scripts
   - Changed from `ros2 launch mavros px4.launch` with wrong ports
   - To: `ros2 run mavros mavros_node --ros-args --param fcu_url:='udp://:14550@127.0.0.1:14540'`
   - All launch scripts now use consistent MAVROS configuration

2. **Improved Pattern Generation**
   - Fixed overlapping square pattern - removed redundant return to start
   - Added sharp 90¬∞ turns to zigzag with intermediate waypoints
   - Implemented yaw control - drone faces direction of travel
   - Added new lawnmower pattern for systematic coverage
   - Created improved_pattern_generator.py and improved_pattern_executor.py

3. **Fixed Visualization Issues**
   - Created terminal_map.py - ASCII visualization without matplotlib
   - No more focus stealing or matplotlib version conflicts
   - Real-time drone tracking in terminal with grid display

4. **Attitude-Based Flight Control**
   - Created attitude_pattern_executor.py using MAVROS setpoint_raw
   - Drone rotates to face direction BEFORE moving (like real flying)
   - No more sideways sliding - uses forward flight with yaw control
   - Different speeds: cruise (3m/s) and approach (1m/s)
   - Proper control modes: rotating, moving, approaching, idle

#### August 6 (Evening) - Pattern System Implementation
1. **Implemented Complete Pattern System**

   - test_pattern_safe.sh - Smaller patterns for testing
   - pattern_test_sequence.sh - Automated test of all patterns

4. **Pattern Visualization Tools**
   - Real-time map showing drone path (blue line)
   - Planned waypoints (green dashed line)
   - Current position (red dot) and target (yellow dot)
   - Alternative terminal monitor for systems without GUI

5. **Fixed Vision System Launch**
   - Corrected to use: `ros2 launch drone_vision_interpreter vision_pipeline.launch.py`
   - Added camera topic parameter for AirSim

6. **Discovered MAVROS Launch Issue**
   - ros2 run mavros not working properly
   - Need to use ros2 launch instead

#### August 6 (Afternoon) - Position Control & Practical LLM
1. **Created Position-Based Movement Controller**
   - Precise movements: "go forward 5 meters" now possible
   - Supports relative movements (forward/back/left/right/up/down X meters)
   - Supports absolute positioning (goto X,Y,Z)
   - Uses `/mavros/setpoint_position/local` for accurate control

2. **Implemented Practical LLM Controller**
   - Works with actual system capabilities (no false promises)
   - Parses natural language into position commands

   - LLM focuses on understanding intent, not low-level control

5. **Fixed QoS Compatibility Issues**
   - Added proper QoS profiles for MAVROS topics (BEST_EFFORT reliability)
   - Position controller and LLM nodes now receive pose data correctly
   - Created dedicated build script (`build_system.sh`)

6. **Hybrid Velocity-Position Controller**
   - Created hybrid controller to fix oscillation issues
   - Converts position targets to velocity commands
   - Works with existing velocity coordinator (priority 2)
   - Smooth approach with no overshoot
   - Speed optimized: 4.0 m/s max velocity, 3m slow-down zone
   - Tested and working with all movement commands including small distances

#### August 5 - LLM Integration & Bug Fixes
1. **Fixed Grid Search Transformation**
   - Applied same coordinate fix as RTH (direct X‚ÜíX, Y‚ÜíY mapping)
   - Grid search now flies proper lawn mower pattern instead of diagonal

2. **Web Interface RTH Fix**
   - Fixed RTH button - now publishes to `/rth_command` with `'rth'`
   - Previously sent wrong command to wrong topic

3. **LLM Integration Setup**
   - OpenAI API key configured
   - Updated enhanced_llm_controller.py to use new OpenAI client syntax

### SimpleFlight Mode (NEW - August 7) üöÄ

#### What is SimpleFlight?
Native AirSim control without PX4/MAVROS - direct, simple, smooth flight control.

#### Location
All SimpleFlight scripts in: `/home/mbs/SAR-Drones-MSc-Thesis/airsim_native_workspace/`

#### Key Advantages
- **No PX4 needed** - Just run UE5 and Python scripts
- **Smooth flight** - Uses AirSim's moveOnPathAsync with lookahead
- **Simple setup** - No MAVROS, no complex launchers
- **Fast testing** - One command to fly patterns
- **Better for demos** - Professional-looking smooth curves

#### Quick Start (SimpleFlight)
```bash
# 1. Switch to SimpleFlight mode
cd /home/mbs/SAR-Drones-MSc-Thesis/airsim_native_workspace
./switch_mode.sh  # Select option 2

# 2. Restart UE5 and press PLAY

# 3. Test connection
python3 scripts/test_connection.py

# 4. Run demos
python3 scripts/hover_test.py              # Basic hover

python3 patterns/search_rescue_pattern.py  # Full SAR mission
```

#### SimpleFlight Scripts
```bash
# Quick start menu (UPDATED with web interface!)
./START_HERE.sh                 # Now includes option 10 for web interface

# Web Interface (NEW!)
./launch_web_interface.sh       # Launch web control at http://localhost:5001

# Individual tests
scripts/test_connection.py      # Test AirSim connection
scripts/hover_test.py           # Basic flight test

# Pattern scripts
patterns/smooth_square.py       # Smooth square with lookahead
patterns/search_rescue_pattern.py # Professional SAR pattern

patterns/safe_pattern_runner.py # Failsafe patterns with guaranteed landing

# Visualization
visualizer/drone_tracker.py     # Real-time position tracker

# Vision integration
vision/camera_test.py           # Test camera feed
vision/camera_feed_yolo.py      # YOLO detection on camera feed

# Web Interface
web_interface/simpleflight_web_server.py  # Flask web server for SimpleFlight control
```

#### Key Differences (SimpleFlight vs PX4)
| Feature | SimpleFlight | PX4 Mode |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Setup** | Just UE5 | PX4 + MAVROS + ROS2 |
| **Camera** | "0" | "front_center" |
| **Vehicle** | "Drone1" | "PX4" |
| **Control** | Direct API | Through MAVROS |
| **Smoothness** | Very smooth | Can be jerky |
| **Deployment** | Simulation only | Can deploy to real drone |

### Next Session Plan (August 9) üéØ

#### Priority 1: Choose Flight Mode
**ASK USER AT START**: "Which mode today - SimpleFlight (demos) or PX4 (realistic)?"

#### Priority 2: Complete LLM Integration
1. **Pattern LLM Bridge Created**
   - Already have pattern_llm_bridge.py
   - Need to test integration
   - Update practical_llm to recognize pattern commands

2. **Test Complete System**
   - Full integration test with patterns
   - Natural language pattern commands
   - Ensure smooth execution

#### Priority 3: Demo Preparation
1. **Create Compelling Demo Scenarios**
   - "Missing hiker" scenario with grid search
   - Precision navigation demo (go to specific coordinates)
   - Natural language control showcase
   
2. **Fix Remaining Issues**
   - PX4 startup timing (add UE5 wait)
   - Test emergency stop integration
   - Ensure stable performance for demo

#### Priority 4: Documentation & Video
1. **Record Demo Videos**
   - System startup procedure
   - Natural language control examples
   - Search and rescue scenario
   
2. **Prepare Thesis Materials**
   - System architecture diagrams
   - Performance metrics
   - Future work recommendations

### Time Remaining: 7 days
Focus areas:
- Days 6-7: Complete LLM integration and advanced features
- Days 8-9: System robustness and edge case handling
- Days 10-12: Documentation and demo recording
- Days 13-14: Final testing and presentation prep
- Day 15: Thesis submission

### Multi-Drone Implementation Strategy (If Time Allows)
**IMPORTANT**: If user says "okay let's add more drones":
1. **Create separate repository** - DO NOT modify current working system
2. **Copy entire SAR-Drones-MSc-Thesis** to new repo (e.g., SAR-Drones-Multi-Agent)
3. **Implement multi-drone features** in the copy only
4. **Original repo remains untouched** as safety net for demo

This ensures we always have a working single-drone system for the thesis demo.

### Key Decisions Made
#### August 6
1. **Hybrid Control Architecture** - Velocity-based position control prevents oscillation
2. **Speed Optimization** - 4.0 m/s max velocity for responsive movement
3. **Build System** - Separate build script from launch scripts

#### August 5
1. **Single Drone Focus** - Prioritizing perfection over multiple drones
2. **GPT-3.5-turbo** - Chosen over GPT-4 for cost/speed (30x cheaper, 3x faster)
3. **Direct Coordinate Mapping** - Fixed grid search to use X‚ÜíX, Y‚ÜíY like RTH

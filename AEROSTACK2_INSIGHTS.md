# AeroStack2 Pattern Execution Insights

## Key Findings from AeroStack2 Analysis

### 1. Control Architecture
**AeroStack2 Approach:**
- Uses **continuous position setpoints** with velocity constraints
- Implements **differential flatness controller** for trajectory tracking
- Separates behaviors into plugins (position-based vs trajectory-based)

**Our Previous Issues:**
- Velocity-only control caused overshooting
- No acceleration planning led to abrupt stops
- Fighting between multiple controllers

### 2. Trajectory Generation
**AeroStack2 Methods:**
- Polynomial trajectory generation with position, velocity, and acceleration
- Trapezoidal velocity profiles for smooth motion
- Feedforward control with velocity and acceleration references

**What We Learned:**
- Need to plan acceleration/deceleration phases
- Velocity feedforward helps prevent lag
- Tighter position thresholds (0.5m vs 2.0m)

### 3. Solutions Implemented

#### Smooth Trajectory Executor (`smooth_trajectory_executor.py`)
Based on AeroStack2's approach:
```python
# Trapezoidal velocity profile
if t < accel_time:
    # Acceleration phase
    s = 0.5 * max_acceleration * t * t
    v = max_acceleration * t
elif t < T - accel_time:
    # Constant velocity phase
    s = ... + max_speed * (t - accel_time)
else:
    # Deceleration phase
    s = total_distance - 0.5 * max_acceleration * (t_decel) ** 2
```

**Key Improvements:**
1. **Trajectory Planning**: Pre-computes duration and velocity profile for each segment
2. **Smooth Acceleration**: Limits acceleration to 2.0 m/sÂ²
3. **Velocity Feedforward**: Sends both position AND velocity setpoints
4. **PATH_FACING Yaw**: Automatically faces direction of travel
5. **20Hz Control Loop**: Matches AeroStack2's update rate

### 4. Testing the New Approach

Run the smooth trajectory executor:
```bash
./test_smooth_patterns.sh
```

Then test with patterns:
```bash
# Small precise square
ros2 topic pub /pattern_command std_msgs/msg/String "data: 'square:5'" --once
ros2 topic pub /pattern_control std_msgs/msg/String "data: 'start'" --once
```

### 5. Expected Improvements
- **No Overshooting**: Smooth deceleration before waypoints
- **No Circular Loops**: Precise waypoint arrival
- **Faster Execution**: Can maintain higher speeds between waypoints
- **Better Turns**: Smooth rotation combined with translation

### 6. Alternative Approaches from AeroStack2

If smooth trajectory executor still has issues, consider:

1. **Full Trajectory Service**: Implement polynomial trajectory generator
2. **Differential Flatness**: Port their controller for better tracking
3. **Behavior Plugins**: Separate position vs trajectory modes

### 7. Integration with Existing System

The smooth trajectory executor works with:
- `launch_hybrid_system.sh` - Uses MAVROS setpoint_raw directly
- Pattern generator - Same waypoint format
- Visualizer - Same status messages

No conflicts because it publishes to `/mavros/setpoint_raw/local` directly, bypassing the velocity coordinator.

## Conclusion

AeroStack2's sophisticated approach shows that proper trajectory planning with acceleration profiles is essential for smooth, accurate flight. Our new `smooth_trajectory_executor` implements these concepts while maintaining compatibility with our existing system.

# August 3, 2025 - Evening Session Summary

## Major Findings

### 1. RTH 'Stop' Command Bug
- **Issue**: RTH node's `simple_command_callback` was intercepting 'stop' commands
- **Code**: `if cmd == 'stop' or cmd == 'rth' or 'return' in cmd:`
- **Impact**: When user sent 'stop' to halt movement, RTH activated instead
- **Fix Applied**: Removed 'stop' from the condition

### 2. RTH System Hijacking
- **Issue**: Once RTH activates, it's nearly impossible to stop
- **Cause**: 
  - Publishes at 10Hz continuously
  - Has priority 4 in velocity coordinator (higher than manual commands)
  - No proper cancellation mechanism
- **Impact**: Only emergency stop works, which breaks velocity coordinator

### 3. Coordinate Transformation Still Wrong
- **Current Behavior**: Drone flies "back-left" when it should fly "forward-left"
- **Attempted Fix**: Double negation (-Y→X, -X→Y) made it worse
- **Theory**: Need to test each transformation systematically

## Code Changes Made

### 1. Fixed return_to_home_node.py
```python
# Before:
if cmd == 'stop' or cmd == 'rth' or 'return' in cmd:
    self.activate_rth()

# After:
if cmd == 'rth' or 'return' in cmd:
    self.activate_rth()
```

### 2. Attempted Coordinate Fix
```python
# Tried double negation (didn't work):
transformed_vel.linear.x = -vel_cmd.linear.y
transformed_vel.linear.y = -vel_cmd.linear.x
```

## New Diagnostic Tools Created

### 1. test_rth_directions.py
- Bypasses velocity coordinator (publishes directly to MAVROS)
- Tests 5 different coordinate transformations
- Allows systematic identification of correct transformation

### 2. test_rth_bypass.sh
- Step-by-step guide for testing without RTH interference
- Ensures RTH node is killed before testing

## Key Insights

1. **The system has multiple overlapping control paths** causing conflicts
2. **Emergency stop breaks the velocity coordinator** requiring full restart
3. **The coordinate transformation needs systematic testing** not guessing

## Tomorrow's Plan (August 4)

1. **Morning**: Run test_rth_directions.py with each transformation
2. **Identify**: Which transformation produces "forward-left" movement
3. **Update**: RTH node with correct transformation
4. **Add**: Proper RTH cancellation (not just emergency stop)
5. **Test**: Full system integration

## Questions for Tomorrow

1. Should RTH publish through velocity coordinator or directly to MAVROS?
2. How to properly cancel RTH without emergency stop?
3. Should we add a "pause" command that temporarily disables RTH?

## Time Spent Today
- Morning session: ~3 hours (system analysis)
- Afternoon session: ~3.25 hours (coordinate debugging)
- Evening session: ~2 hours (RTH debugging)
- Total: ~8.25 hours

## Status
- Days until deadline: 12
- Critical path: Fix coordinates → Test system → Write thesis
- Confidence level: Medium (have clear diagnostic path forward)

# Context for Next Session - August 3, 2025 (Session 2)

## Where We Left Off

### Current Situation
- System overhaul completed but RTH still broken (drifts right)
- PX4 refuses to arm after running scripts (preflight failures)
- Coordinate transformations updated but may need reverting

### Key Discovery
The system had **compensating errors**:
1. Smart keep-alive had inverted X-axis (wrong)
2. Grid search compensated with negated transformation (wrong)
3. Two wrongs made it work!
4. We "fixed" both, now it's broken differently

### Immediate Tests Needed
1. **Isolate Smart Keep-Alive Test**
   ```bash
   # Only run smart keep-alive and test each direction
   ros2 run llm_controller smart_keep_alive_node
   # Send forward/back/left/right commands
   # Document EXACT drone movement
   ```

2. **Test Raw MAVROS Commands**
   ```bash
   # Send velocity directly to MAVROS
   ros2 topic pub /mavros/setpoint_velocity/cmd_vel_unstamped geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 1.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}}"
   # Document which direction drone moves
   ```

3. **Position vs Velocity Coordinates**
   - Position from MAVROS might use different frame than velocity
   - Need to test both separately

### Suspected Issues
1. **Double Transformation**: We might be transforming coordinates twice somewhere
2. **Position Frame**: RTH uses position for direction calculation - might need different handling
3. **PX4 State**: Backspace in AirSim only resets visual, not PX4's internal state

### Quick Diagnostic Commands
```bash
# Check what's actually being sent
ros2 topic echo /keepalive/velocity_command
ros2 topic echo /rth/velocity_command  
ros2 topic echo /mavros/setpoint_velocity/cmd_vel_unstamped

# Monitor position during RTH
ros2 topic echo /mavros/local_position/pose
```

### Files That Need Checking
1. Smart keep-alive might need X-axis reverted
2. OR transformation in RTH/grid search needs negation added back
3. BUT NOT BOTH!

### Next Session Plan
1. Start with isolated component testing
2. Establish ground truth for coordinates
3. Fix one component at a time
4. Test after each change
